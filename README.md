# Show and tell for designers.
What are you working on? Glass Prison is a community of designers answering that question each day. Web designers, graphic designers, illustrators, icon artists, typographers, logo designers, and other creative types share small screenshots that show their work, process, and current projects.

Glass Prison is a place to show and tell, promote, discover, and explore design.
